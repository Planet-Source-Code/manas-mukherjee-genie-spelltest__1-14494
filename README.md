### Description

I downloaded sapi4sdksuite.exe from microsoft, and noticed many of you have contributed codes using TTS and voice command. I am just following the trail. You also need Msagent and Genie.exe for window 98. I developed this program in W 2k professional and tested in win 98. With option buttons, I tried to load a text pad with words, TTS will say the word to spell. I used combo box to display correct/incorrect word and track down if word is retyped during the test or we are trying to cheat the test typing one word over and again. Codes are very simple, I would take positive feed back. I targeted this application to 2/3rd graders. We can Edit the note pads (zipped) as you like and then take the test.

You will be able to reshape the form using handles.
